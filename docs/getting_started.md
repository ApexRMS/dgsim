# Getting started with **DG-Sim**

## Quickstart Tutorial

This quickstart tutorial will introduce you to basics of working with DG-Sim. The steps we will lead you through include:
<br>
* Installing a Packages
* Creating a new library
* Viewing and editing model Datafeeds
* Running a Model
* Analyzing the Results

<br>
<br>
## Step 1: Install DG-Sim
**DG-Sim** is a module within the [SyncroSim](https://syncrosim.com/) simulation modeling framework; as such, running **DG-Sim** requires that the **SyncroSim** software be installed on your computer.
1. To install **DG-Sim**, follow the instructions under [How to Install](https://apexrms.github.io/dgsim/)
2. Once installed, open the **SyncroSim** Windows application.
<br>
<br>
## Step 2: Create a new DG-Sim library
Having installed the **DG-Sim** package, you are now ready to create your first SyncroSim Library. A Library is a file (with extension *.ssim*) that contains all of your model inputs and outputs. Note that the format of each Library is specific to the Package for which it was initially created. To create a new Library, choose **New Library...** from the **File** menu.
<br>
In this window:
<br>
* Select the row for the **dgsim - Simulates demographics of wildlife populations**. Note that as you select a row, the list of **Templates** available and suggested file **Name** for that base package are updated.
* Select the **Simple Pop. Model** Template as shown above.
* Optionally type in a new **Name** for the Library (or accept the default); you can also change the **Location** of the file using the **Browse...** button.
<br>
When you are ready to create the Library file, click **OK**. A new Library will be created and loaded into the Library Explorer.
