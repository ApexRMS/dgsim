## Simulate demographics of wildlife populations
### *DG-Sim* is an open-source [SyncroSim](https://syncrosim.com/){:target="_blank"} Base Package for forecasting wildlife population size and harvest.


The **DG-Sim** package consists of a general population-modeling framework which uses a stochastic, stage-structured matrix approach to project wildlife abundance over time. Built upon the [SyncroSim](https://syncrosim.com/){:target="_blank"} software platform, **DG-Sim** is a wildlife harvest management tool capable of exploring the effects of alternative future harvest quotas and scenarios. Users of **DG-Sim** can choose to incorporate model inputs for their population of interest including, but not limited to: birth rate estimates, natural mortality rates, target harvest levels, and initial sub‐population size. The stochastic nature of **DG‐Sim** allows model projections to incorporate uncertainty in model inputs.

**DG-Sim** has been continuously developed with a user-friendly interface in mind. As such, users of the package are given the flexibility and control to interactively undertake “what‐if” analyses of model projections. **DG-Sim**'s accessible framework has helped support natural resource governance projects such as a community-led harvest calculator for muskoxen in Greenland, allowing for collaborative harvest management planning between community, industry, and government [(Cuyler, Daniel, Enghoff et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.159){:target="_blank"}. **DG-Sim** currently offers multi-language support in English, Greenlandic, and Danish.
